  <h1>Triangle Tracker Website</h1>
  <p>This is a website that checks what type of a triangle you inqured and returns the result.</p>
  <p><strong>The three types of triangle you can create are:</strong></p>
 <ul>
   <li>An <em>equilateral</strong> triangle with three equal sides.</em>
   <li>An <em>isosceles</strong> triangle with at least two equal sides.</em>
   <li>An <em>scalene</strong> triangle with no equal sides.</em>
</ul>
<p><em>If the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side, this CANNOT be a triangle hence NOT a triangle will be returned</em></p>
